      <section id="residency">
        <h3> Hometown </h3>
        <p> Born and raised on the southside of Chicago, Illinois. I lived in the
            Back of the Yards neighborhood until the age of 10. My family
            relocated to the Garfield Ridge area, also referred to as Midway. I
            still live there to this day. Chicago is all I know, but I plan
            to travel away from my home roots upon graduation in 2019!</p>

        <h3> Sports Teams </h3>
        <p> I wholeheartedly believe that an individual cannot be both a Sox fan
            and Cubs fan. The whole point of living in this city is picking a
            team to keep the rivalry alive. Therefore, Sox pride all the way!
            I'm also a Bears fan, a Bulls fan, and a Blackhawks fan. Did I
            mention I have worked for a security company who was hired for
            Bears games, Sox games, and Cubs games? Yes, it was awesome- even
            when I worked the Cubs games because I got to live-up the cross-town
            rivalry.</p>

        <h3> Astrology </h3>
        <p> I was born on September 28th, so my zodiac sign is the Libra;
            however, my moon is a Virgo due to the time I was born (early a.m.)!
            The symbol for Libra is the scales. Therefore, I am always looking
            at both sides of the spectrum. DISCLAIMER: I do NOT think that
            everything in your life happens as a result of your zodiac sign, but
            I do believe some characteristics apply to individuals depending on
            when they were born.</p>

        <h3> Hobbies </h3>
        <ul>
          <li> Singing </li>
            <li> I do not have a certain genre that I like. It all really depends
                on my mood for the day. I can sing Mariah Carey one second and
                rock out to Lynard Skynard the next. </li>
          <li> Dancing </li>
            <li> I do not take any classes in dance. I'm more of a random dancing
                type of girl. </li>
          <li> Physical Activities </li>
            <li> If I have an option to drive or walk, I will always choose to
                walk! At my job, we are always doing some type of cardio, which
                is my favorite thing to do! I cannot sit still. </li>
          <li> Cooking </li>
            <li> My speciality is pasta. Friends and family say that they have
                never had noodles like mine. I also like to cook Mexican food
                such as tostadas, enchiladas, and tacos. I put my heart and soul
                into cooking because I grew up with a family who loves to eat.
