        <h3> Sports Teams </h3>
        <p> I wholeheartedly believe that an individual cannot be both a Sox fan
            and Cubs fan. The whole point of living in this city is picking a
            team to keep the rivalry alive. Therefore, Sox pride all the way!
            I'm also a Bears fan, a Bulls fan, and a Blackhawks fan.

        <h3> Zodiac Sign </h3>
        <p> I was born on September 28th, so my zodiac sign is a Libra;
            however, my moon is a Virgo due to the time I was born (early a.m.)!
            The symbol for Libra is the scales, so I am always looking at both
            sides of the spectrum. DISCLAIMER: I do NOT think that everything in
            your life happens as a result of your zodiac sign, but I do believe
            some characteristics apply to individuals depending on when they
            were born. INSERT IMAGE HERE</p>
